# linear-regression-UFC

The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an organization that hosts Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fights at the highest caliber in the world and is largely responsible for the growing popularity of the sport today.  
As a practitioner and fan of the sport I have often wondered what causes certain fighters to win and certain fighters to lose (despite the Las Vegas odds).  
This is a very complex question, therefore I used an approach that takes a look at two explanatory variables and one response variable listed below: 

**Explanatory1:**  *Total Rounds Fought by the Fighter* (also referred to as *Rounds Fought*)  
**Explanatory2:**  *Total Wins via Knock Out (KO) or Technical Knock Out (TKO)* (referred to as *Win.KO*)  
**Response:** *Total Number of Wins by the Fighter* (also referred to as *Total Wins*)  

I used these 3 variables to pose the following questions:  
Is there evidence of a linear association between the response variable *Total Wins* and at least one of the two explanatory variables: *Rounds Fought*, *Win.KO*?  
If there is significant evidence that a linear association exists, what are the respective contributions from each variable?


This repository explores these questions and more using UFC data which was originally acquired from kaggle.com/mdabbert, to demonstrate linear regression models using R.
